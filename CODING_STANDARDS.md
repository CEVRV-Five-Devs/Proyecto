# Coding Standards

Welcome to the Five Devs coding standards. Following consistent coding standards helps maintain a clean and organized project. Contributors are expected to adhere to the guidelines outlined below, with a focus on Blueprint scripting for Unreal Engine 5.

1. [General Guidelines](#general-guidelines)
2. [Blueprint Naming Conventions](#blueprint-naming-conventions)
3. [Blueprint Organization](#blueprint-organization)
4. [Documentation](#documentation)

## General Guidelines

- Write Blueprint scripts that are easy to understand and maintain.
- Follow the [Unreal Engine Style Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/CodingStandard/) when applicable.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and nodes.
- Avoid unnecessary comments; use descriptive node titles.

## Blueprint Naming Conventions

- Follow the [Unreal Engine Style Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/recommended-asset-naming-conventions-in-unreal-engine-projects/) for naming conventions.
- Follow the [Blueprint Best Practices](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/blueprint-best-practices-in-unreal-engine/) for naming conventions.
- Use PascalCase for custom Blueprint classes (e.g., `BP_MyCharacter`, `BP_MyWidget`).
- Prefix boolean variables with "b" (e.g., `bIsEnabled`).

## Blueprint Organization

- Organize Blueprint graphs with clear comment boxes.
- Use separate functions and macros for reusable logic.
- Group related nodes together for better readability.
- Name Blueprint graphs logically, reflecting their purpose.

## Documentation

- Provide comments for complex logic or where clarification is needed.
- Use node tooltips to provide brief explanations for each node.
- Document custom Blueprint classes, functions, and variables using the description field in the Details panel.

## Conclusion

By following these coding standards, we aim to create a Blueprint scripting structure that is consistent, understandable, and maintainable. Thank you for contributing to Five Devs using Unreal Engine 5!
